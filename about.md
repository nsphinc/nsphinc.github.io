Hi, I'm Gabriel. 

I'm reading **Information Engineering** at the University of Oxford. 

I'm in my final Masters year and am working on **my thesis**: *Optimisation-based Actions with Applications in Market Microstructure*. 
This looks at limit-order book trading strategies from the perspectives of modern control theory, specifically through model predictive control and reinforcement learning. 

I'm fascinated by the study of complex and dynamic systems from a quantitative perspective, and you can find **some projects** I've been working on [here]({{ site.baseurl }}projects/).

In my **spare time** you can probably find me nose-deep in a book on theology, or out on long scenic evening walks.

**My CV** can be found [here]({{ site.cvurl }}){:target="_blank"}.

## This site

This site was rendered in Jekyll with a customised [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) template.

The title is a cheeky nod to a Star Trek novel, but one that I also find quite apt when thinking about my interests in quantitative matters.
