Hi, I'm Gabriel. 

I'm a rising 4th year at the University of Oxford reading Information Engineering. This will be my Masters year and I will be working on my thesis *Optimisation-based Actions in Financial Markets* looking at limit-order book strategies from the perspectives of control theory and reinforcement learning. 

I'm fascinated by the study of complex and dynamic systems from a quantitative perspective, and you can find some projects I've been working on [here](/projects.md).

In my spare time you can probably either find me nose-deep in a book on theology, or out on long scenic evening walks.
