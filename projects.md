This page describes some projects that I have worked on. 

These revolve around my developing interests in modelling and machine learning in Quantitative Finance and Neurotech:

* [Deep Option Hedging with Reinforcement Learning](#deep-option-hedging-with-reinforcement-learning)
* [Portfolio Optimisation with Particles](#portfolio-optimisation-with-particles)
* [Portfolio Optimisation with Lead-Lag Opportunities](#portfolio-optimisation-with-lead-lag-opportunities)
* [Activity Detection with Neural Networks and Muscular Biosignals](#activity-detection-with-neural-networks-and-muscular-biosignals)
* [Dimensionality Reduction Techniques](#dimensionality-reduction-techniques)
* [Detection of Emotions with Discriminant Analysis and EEG](#detection-of-emotions-with-discriminant-analysis-and-eeg)

## Deep Option Hedging with Reinforcement Learning

This project attempted to recreate the findings of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07467) that presented a method for finding optimal hedging policies.

The authors formulated an actor-critic algorithm for solving an expression of general risk-averse stochastic control problems. This algorithm was then used to learn hedging strategies across multiple risk aversion levels simultaneously.

Specifically,

## Portfolio Optimisation with Lead-Lag Opportunities

This was a project I did with the Oxford Alpha Fund.

## Activity Detection with Neural Networks and Muscular Biosignals

I studied cough detection using machine learning for my undergraduate capstone project. This was done towards the broader goal of designing a medical wearable to alleviate the symptoms of Stress Urinary Incontinence.

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

This was a mini-project that I undertook with the Oxford Alpha Fund (OAF). 

The curse of dimensionality is one that plagues large-scale quantitative problems. I looked at popular dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA and ???, and delivered a presentation to the rest of my OAF cohort.

## Detection of Emotions with Discriminant Analysis and EEG

This research project was undertaken with the [Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r), a department under the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR) in Singapore, one of the country's largest IT research institutes.

I led a team of 3 to investigate the detection of emotional responses to audiovisual stimuli from electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. 

This was done by training a classifier with disciminant analysis and then testing the classifier's inter-subject performance. The EEG data was collected from a small-scale clinical trial of 27 participants who were presented a series of audiovisual cues.

We wrote a paper that was published with [IRC-SET](https://ircset.org/main/conference-2023/).
