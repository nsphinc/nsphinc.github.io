Here's a description of some of the projects that I have worked on in the past year. 

These generally revolve around my developing interests in all things computational in real-world systems, and that primarily invovles modelling and machine learning in Quantitative Finance and Neurotech:

* [Portfolio Optimisation with Particles](#portfolio-optimisation-with-particles)
* [Dynamic Option Hedging](#dynamic-option-hedging)
* [Lead-Lag Portfolio Optimisation](#lead-lag-portfolio-optimisation)
* [Neural Networks and Biosignals](#neural-networks-and-biosignals)
* [Dimensionality Reduction Techniques](#dimensionality-reduction-techniques)
